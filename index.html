            “Who am I?” I am who I choose to be. If life has taught me one
            important thing, it would be the fact that I could resent everyone
            that have done me 'wrong' for the rest of my life. Furthermore, I
            can judge everyone around me but it's going to eventually destroy
            myself. When I let my hatred and resentments go, I feel less
            burdened despite having debts, an ailing health and a stumbling
            business. Ruminations have plagued me for years and it takes
            painstaking effort to remind myself: it happened in the past...let
            it go! I have learnt to let it go and move forward. Sound easy? You
            decide. If you want to know who you really are and need that change,
            then pop by sometime for coffee and we will discuss. However, before
            commiting to a session, I implore you to leave the ego and every
            other emotion that accompanies you. I just exist to listen, to
            comprehend and connect. That's about it. It's as simple as that. We
            deal with the challenges and emotional moments you may encounter in
            life by using pragmatic strategies.

          <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Eradicate that resentments and guilt and thinking about the 'If's'.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been attempting to do one thing in my life and that is to “BE
          HAPPY”. Alcoholism and depression was my life for almost 7 years SINCE
          the year 2006 and it basically led me to severe liver cirrhosis and
          “almost” certain death.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to deal with the most painful moment in my life and the fact
          that the liver consultant mentioned for the fact that I was in a grave
          condition and might not pull through the next few weeks and I was
          “hanging by a thread.” It daunted upon me at that time firstly, I
          hadn't much time to live;
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I haven't done the things I wanted to and was in a
          despondent state. Tears welled up in my eyes as I realised the
          possibility that I wasn't going to see my son grow up. I was
          completely devastated, defeated and destroyed. Any visitors I had just
          gave me that sort of pitiful gaze and the look of despair and
          hopelessness. If there was anything I ever knew about the society I
          lived; was one of a selfish and non-compassionate society for
          alcoholics. It had almost seemed to me that I might not be given a
          second chance at life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time stood still, and every second seemed a lifetime. I had 2 choices.
          Stay and Rot or get out of the hospital. I had 2 solutions, decrease
          my bilirubin toxic levels and get out and carry on feeling sorry with
          myself. Either way I ran the risk of dying. I contemplated the former.
          1 week later I moved out of hospital with a decrease in my toxic
          levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still had the support of my son and my wonderful wife. I still had
          hope. It was all I ever needed. I leveraged on the support I got to
          get back on my feet and stopped all forms of medications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in a society that focuses on results and I realised I could not
          conform to it. I had to change my attitude towards my life in to pull
          away from the dreaded misery I was in. I honestly never believed in
          therapy as I never believed it was going to work for me; and yet
          here's the most surprising thing for me after 10 years,
        </p>

        <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
          <li class="list-group-item">Have been sober</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            have managed to control my anxiety (in most cases)
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">I have redefined my idea of success</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            I am trying to let go my perceived perception of they way people
            perceive me (it isn't a pun)
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            I have almost eradicated the “3 deadly sins” - (in my own opinion)
            from without any hard-fast methodologies or rules and protocols.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="bulletpoints my-4">
          <ul>
            <li>Anger -that's a tough one</li>
            <li>Being judgmental - That's another tough one</li>
            <li>
              Guilt - oh that kills most of us leading us to lie not just others
              but to oursellves which automatically leads to shame -shame of
              past actions and its repercussions, debts, vices etc..
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          All these led to myself losing track of who I really am. It just made
          me feel extremely small inside.
        </p>
        <p>So….. the BIG QUESTION, How did I pull it off?</p>
        <p>
          That's where you get to meet me at the live sessions that I would be
          having to explain the concept of 2W's and yes my acronym which
          constitutes to my name S.R.E.E.
        </p>

        <b>S - Stay away</b>
        <br />
        <b>R - Restart/Reboot</b>
        <br />
        <b>E - Eradicate</b>
        <br />
        <b>E - Empower</b>
        <br />

        <p>
          At this current stage, I m not here to earn the dough but it would be
          good to have some in the coffers. I am here to fact find and share my
          experiences. Yes, I have a couple of certs but so does many out there.
          I am no psychologist. If you don't have the $$$ or little of it or you
          have attempted all avenue's that didn't really work out and you really
          have nothing to lose, then hey, I say this to you, try me… or…. my
          simple strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is not validated and I am not converting anyone into a true
          believer. All I am saying, “If you have nothing to lose and have time
          to spare and need someone to assure you and coach you back to the
          direction that you feel or might want; then move on to the next
          steps.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, for those who have taken the time to read through my
          ramblings, my sincerest gratitude and I applaud you for not dozing
          off. I say this to you, “Thank you!”, from the bottom of my heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Who am I?” I am a nobody who has nothing but everything. If life has
          taught me one important thing would be the fact that I could hate
          everyone for the rest of my life and judge everyone around me but it's
          going to destroy me and not anyone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have no baggage even though I have debts, an ailing health, and no
          success in business. I have learnt to let it go and move forward.
          Sound easy? You decide.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not interested in unnecessary criticisms. If you are to know who
          you really are and need that change; then pop by sometime for coffee
          to know S.R.E.E. Leave the ego and every other emotion that
          accompanies you that help in progression outside the door. I exist to
          listen, to comprehend and connect. That's about it. It's as simple as
          that.
